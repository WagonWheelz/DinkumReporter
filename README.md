## üîß Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```
   git clone https://github.com/WagonWheelz/DinkumReporter.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**
(This failed for me so I had to install each requirement manually)
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure credentials**

   Create a `config.py` file (already included) and place in both your username and your APP password. You will need to generate an app password in bluesky:

```
   USERNAME = "yourhandle.bsky.social"
   APP_PASSWORD = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

4. **Add a thumbnail image**

   Place your preferred image in the bot folder as `thumbnail2.png`
   (This gets uploaded with each post).

5. **Adjust any blocklist settings you want**

   Review the existing blocklist in `news_fetcher.py`

6. **Run the bot**

   In your terminal run `python main.py`, If the setup works correctly, It will run through and pull the articles from the fetcher and prompt you for approval. Select Y or N depending on the approval and then you're ready!

## ü§ñ AI Disclosure

ChatGPT was used in the original code for the OwOify version of this bot. As the code is identical, that also means some aspects may have fingerprints of AI use in them. Please see the disclosure there. ChatGPT was not used for any further additions for this specific bot.
